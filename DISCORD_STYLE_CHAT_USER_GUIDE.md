## Tips & Best Practices

### Organizing Your Categories

- **By Subject**: Create categories for each subject (Math, Physics, Chemistry)
- **By Purpose**: Create categories for different activities (Study Groups, Homework Help, Projects)
- **By Team**: Create private categories for specific study groups

### Channel Naming

- Use clear, descriptive names
- Keep names short and concise
- Use lowercase for consistency
- Examples:
  - `general` - Main discussion channel
  - `homework-help` - For homework questions
  - `exam-prep` - For exam preparation
  - `announcements` - For important updates

### Privacy Considerations

- **Public channels**: Great for open discussions and community building
- **Private channels**: Perfect for team projects, sensitive discussions, or exclusive study groups
- Remember: Once a channel is created, changing visibility requires admin intervention

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Enter**: Send message
- **Escape**: Close modal dialogs
- **Up/Down Arrow**: Navigate between channels (coming soon)
